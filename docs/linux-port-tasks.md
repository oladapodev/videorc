# Linux Port Tasks

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: use `compose:tdd` for every
> behavior change and `compose:execute` to run approved slices with checkpoints.
> Check a box only after the named evidence exists.

**Goal:** Implement the approved Linux architecture in dependency order while
keeping macOS and Windows green.

**Architecture:** Linux adds portal, PipeWire, preview, and encoder adapters to
the existing Rust media backend. A deterministic policy selects adapters from
simple presets or validated expert settings and reports every fallback.

**Tech stack:** Rust 2024, Tokio, XDG Desktop Portal over D-Bus, PipeWire/SPA,
FFmpeg/FFprobe, VA-API/DRM, Electron 39, React 19, TypeScript 5.9,
electron-builder, Vitest, Node test runner, GitHub Actions.

**Specification:** `docs/linux-architecture.md`

**Delivery plan:** `docs/linux-port-plan.md`

---

## [T1] Execution protocol

**Covers:** S3, S18, S19, S20

Every task uses this sequence:

- [ ] Read the task, its `Covers` sections, and every named file before editing.
- [ ] Write one minimal behavior test.
- [ ] Run the focused command and confirm the test fails for the missing behavior,
  not because of a typo, missing dependency, or broken fixture.
- [ ] Add the smallest production change that makes the test pass.
- [ ] Run the focused test and confirm clean output.
- [ ] Refactor only while the focused and neighboring tests stay green.
- [ ] Run the task gate.
- [ ] Update the relevant docs/status/evidence.
- [ ] Review the diff for secrets, generated media, unrelated files, silent
  fallbacks, and platform regressions.
- [ ] Commit only the task files with a focused conventional commit.

Configuration-only workflow/package steps still require executable validation
tests before production configuration is written. Real-device behavior adds a
dated acceptance run after automated tests; it does not replace TDD.

## [T2] Slice 0 - Linux acceptance contract and evidence layout

**Covers:** S1, S2, S12, S17, S18

**User benefit:** The owner gets an honest checklist showing what the downloaded
package can actually do on the target laptop.

**Files:**

- Create: `docs/acceptance/linux-app-acceptance-template.md`
- Create: `scripts/lib/linux-acceptance-gate.mjs`
- Create: `scripts/lib/linux-acceptance-gate.test.mjs`
- Modify: `.gitignore`
- Modify: `package.json`

- [x] RED: add a Node test that rejects an acceptance manifest missing GNOME
  Wayland, portal, PipeWire, capture, preview, encoder, final-artifact, A/V,
  process-cleanup, and redaction evidence.
- [ ] Verify RED:

  ```bash
  node --test scripts/lib/linux-acceptance-gate.test.mjs
  ```

  Expected: fail while missing files exist. If `node` is unavailable locally,
  run the equivalent check through `.github/workflows/linux.yml` and confirm the
  red-step failure in workflow logs before implementing the validator.
- [x] GREEN: implement the pure manifest validator and format its failures as
  one actionable line per missing proof.
- [x] Add the dated template with exact commands, artifact paths, manual checks,
  and rollback recording fields.
- [x] Ignore `docs/acceptance/artifacts/linux/` explicitly even though its parent
  is already ignored, documenting the intended evidence location.
- [x] Add
  `pnpm acceptance:linux:verify -- /tmp/videorc-linux-acceptance/manifest.json`.
- [x] Verify GREEN and task gate:

  ```bash
  node --test scripts/lib/linux-acceptance-gate.test.mjs
  pnpm check:text-files
  ```

## [T3] Slice 1 - Shared settings and capability protocol

**Covers:** S5, S10, S11, S12, S14

  cargo test -p videorc-backend protocol
  ```

  Expected: TypeScript reports missing Linux media types and Rust rejects unknown
  fixture fields.
- [ ] GREEN: add matching Rust/TypeScript types, conservative defaults, strict
  schema bounds, and unknown-enum normalization to `automatic` with a diagnostic.
- [ ] Add table-driven Rust tests proving valid settings, rejected invalid device
  paths/rates/queue sizes, and intent/observation separation.
- [ ] Verify GREEN and task gate:

  ```bash
  cargo test -p videorc-backend media_policy protocol

  environment secrets, portal tokens, and device serials.
- [ ] Verify RED:

  ```bash
  node --test scripts/lib/linux-hardware-report.test.mjs
  cargo test -p videorc-backend linux::platform_probe
  ```

  Expected: fail because the probe and redactor are absent.
- [ ] GREEN: implement injectable filesystem/command readers, structured
  capability failures, hardware fingerprinting, and RPC exposure.
- [ ] Add intent comments explaining why `/sys` observation and `/dev` openability
  are separate facts and why an encoder listing is not proof.
- [ ] Verify GREEN and task gate:

  ```bash
  cargo test -p videorc-backend linux::platform_probe
  node --test scripts/lib/linux-hardware-report.test.mjs
  pnpm --filter @videorc/desktop test -- src/shared/backend-rpc-contract.test.ts

  icons, desktop/protocol metadata, and amd64 artifact naming.
- [ ] Add `package:preflight:linux`, `package:desktop:linux`,
  `dist:desktop:linux`, and `smoke:packaged:linux:health` scripts.
- [ ] Add Linux process-tree tests proving only ledger-owned PIDs receive TERM,
  grace, then KILL and that clean exit removes the ledger entry.
- [ ] Task gate, run in GitHub rather than routinely on the target PC:

  ```bash
  pnpm test:scripts
  pnpm --filter @videorc/desktop test

## [T19] Slice 17 - Upstream watcher and tagged Linux release

**Covers:** S16

**User benefit:** Changes from the original repository arrive through visible,
tested sync PRs, and approved tags create permanent Linux downloads with notes.

**Files:**

- Create: `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml`
- Create: `.github/workflows/release-linux.yml`
- Create: scripts/modules/tests for upstream comparison and release-note assembly
- Modify: `docs/releases/release-runbook.md`
- Modify: `docs/distribution.md`

- [ ] RED: test no-change, fast-forward, divergent, existing-sync-PR, untrusted
  fork, missing changelog, failed package, and checksum verification cases.
- [ ] Verify RED:

  ```bash
  pnpm test:scripts
  ```

  Expected: fail because Linux sync/release helpers do not exist.
- [ ] GREEN: schedule upstream comparison, open/update one sync PR, run normal PR
  gates, and require review/checks before fork-main changes.
- [ ] GREEN: on `v*`, build or consume a commit-matched validated package and
  publish an immutable GitHub Release with changelog, commit/PR notes, checksums,
  provenance/build info, and explicit beta/stable channel.
- [ ] Verify the created release through GitHub and download/checksum the `.deb`;
  do not infer success from a tag push.

## [T20] Slice 18 - Clean install, update, rollback, and handoff

**Covers:** S1, S12, S16, S17, S18

**User benefit:** The exact GitHub artifact installs and updates on the owner's PC,
and there is a safe path back to the previous package.

**Files:**

- Copy and complete: `docs/acceptance/linux-app-acceptance-template.md`
- Update: `docs/linux-port-plan.md`
- Update: `docs/linux-port-tasks.md`
- Update: `docs/distribution.md`
- Create for the selected release ID: the matching `changelog/*.md` entry and
  `docs/releases/*.md` engineering record, following the existing release naming
  convention

- [ ] Download the GitHub artifact and verify its SHA-256 before installation.
- [ ] Install with the documented Debian package command and record the actual
  package/version query output.
- [ ] Run packaged health, hardware, device, preview, recording-studio, streaming,
  full-parity, process, and support-bundle gates.
- [ ] Install the next preview/main build without local compilation and verify
  settings, projects, recordings, database, and explicit backend selections.
- [ ] Roll back to the previous known-good `.deb` and verify user recordings remain.
- [ ] Confirm the GitHub run and release page expose downloadable artifacts.
- [ ] Mark Linux v1 complete only after every Definition of Done item in
  `docs/linux-port-plan.md` has current evidence.

## [T21] Required final verification matrix

Before the final Linux release handoff, run or obtain fresh CI evidence for:

```bash
pnpm audit:deps
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm --filter @videorc/desktop test
pnpm test:scripts
cargo fmt --check --all
cargo test -p videorc-backend
cargo clippy -p videorc-backend -- -D warnings
pnpm smoke:recording-studio
pnpm smoke:recording-studio:linux-devices
pnpm smoke:local-gates:linux
pnpm release:validate:linux
```

CI is authoritative for expensive clean compilation and packaging. The target
host is authoritative for GNOME Wayland consent, real devices, VA-API behavior,
preview smoothness, final artifacts, and endurance. A release requires both.
